# Saying Hello To MNIST Dataset ðŸ‘‹
In this project, by using Tensorflow (v.2,) a predictive machine learning algorithm applied to the MNIST dataset.

A 95% prediction accuracy achieved with using 2 hidden layers (size 50) and optimizer as 'adam', loss function as 'sparse categorical crossentropy'. More details are in the notebook itself.

Thanks to the creators of MNIST dataset and tensorflow.org for providing the dataset and a helping hand.
